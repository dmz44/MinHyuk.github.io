Hi my name is MinHyuk Park. You can call me MinHyuk. (Pronounced mi-nhiuhk(en-us), rhymes with chuck).

I am a Ph.D. student researcher in Computer Science specializing in autonomous robotics and multi-agent systems. I possesses a strong record of innovation, including a first-author publication at the premier ICRA robotics conference (2024) and Short papers in Workshops (2023,2025), a granted patent in AI-based defect detection, and multiple awards from international autonomous drone competitions (IROS, Airbus). My expertise is in AI-driven task and motion planning and perception, as well as optimal integration of both hardware and software.

My current research topic is in multi-agent systems and planning for fault-tolerant robotic systems.
